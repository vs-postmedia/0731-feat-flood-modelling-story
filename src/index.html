The analysis is limited to Fraser River freshet flood scenarios, and does not include potential flooding from other rivers or from coastal storm surge. It does not include other potential causes for dike failure, such as erosion or seepage. The map above shows only a subset of dikes in the Fraser Valley.</footer>
